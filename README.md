# magicsim 

## R package to simulate populations from complex crossing schemes, specifically a Multi-parent Advanced Generation Intercrossed (MAGIC) funnel scheme. 

Chrom, Indv, and Pop objects can be manipulated through a series of functions to simulate recombination for any combination of crosses by sampling from a Poisson distribution and information from a genetic map. 

Simulated chromosomes can be visualized using the function plot_Pop()

Simulated crosses can be used to validate other software, such as R/qtl2. Code to convert breatktables into vcf files is in the works...
